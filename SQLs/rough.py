Within the first week, I started understanding customer requirements and ensuring simple deliveries. By the end of the first month, I began guiding other team members in technical deliveries. Within two months, I took charge of all complex delivery and debugging activities while continuously engaging, guiding, and educating team members. I improved the quality of the code delivered, surpassing the standards before I joined, within three months. By the fourth month, I started enhancing centralized frameworks like DDQ.
