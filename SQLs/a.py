Subject: Inquiry Regarding Impact of Recent Layoffs on My PERM Process

Dear Paul,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek your guidance regarding the impact of the recent layoffs at CVS Health on my ongoing PERM process. Given the current situation, I am concerned about the potential for any delays or issues that could arise due to the "cooling-off" period often associated with layoffs during PERM filings.

Additionally, I would like to inquire if there is any direction or plan from the immigration team to mitigate this potential issue or ensure the continuity of the PERM process in such cases.

Please note that I reached out to the attorney last week to get clarification on this matter, but I have not received a response yet. Your insight and any advice you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your support, and I look forward to your guidance.
