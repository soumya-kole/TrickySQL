1. Document Ingestion
Objective: Load and structure the 2000 contract documents.
Process:
Ensure all documents are accessible and in a consistent format (PDFs, Word docs, etc.).
Convert the documents to plain text using a tool like Python’s PyPDF2 or docx libraries if needed.
Structure the text by splitting it into sections (e.g., terms, clauses) to better organize the embedding creation process.
2. Preprocessing and Cleaning
Objective: Prepare the documents for embedding creation.
Process:
Text cleaning: Remove unnecessary symbols, page numbers, and other non-informative content.
Tokenization: Break the text into meaningful chunks, like paragraphs or clauses, as input for the embedding model.
Normalization: Convert all text to lowercase, remove stop words, and ensure legal terms or jargon are preserved.
3. Creating Embeddings Using OpenAI
Objective: Generate vector embeddings for the document text using OpenAI's API.
Process:
Input: Send each preprocessed text chunk (paragraph, section, or document) to OpenAI’s embeddings endpoint (such as text-embedding-ada-002).
Embedding Output: OpenAI will return a high-dimensional vector for each text chunk.
Store each vector embedding with metadata such as the document name, section, or paragraph number.
4. Storing Embeddings in PostgreSQL with Vector Extension
Objective: Store the embeddings and metadata in PostgreSQL using vector capabilities (e.g., pgvector extension).
Process:
PostgreSQL Setup: Install and configure the pgvector extension to support vector storage.
Table Design: Create a table schema that stores each embedding alongside its corresponding metadata:
embedding VECTOR, document_id, section, text_snippet, timestamp, etc.
Insert Embeddings: Store the embeddings returned from OpenAI into the PostgreSQL database, with each embedding mapped to its respective document chunk.
5. User Question Embedding Creation Using OpenAI
Objective: Convert user questions into embeddings for similarity search.
Process:
Input: When a user asks a question (e.g., "What are the payment terms in contract X?"), send the question to OpenAI’s embeddings endpoint.
Embedding Output: OpenAI will return a vector embedding of the user’s question.
6. Vector Search in PostgreSQL
Objective: Search the vector database for relevant document chunks based on the question embedding.
Process:
Use PostgreSQL’s vector search capabilities to compare the user’s question embedding with the document embeddings stored in the database.
Query: Perform a similarity search (e.g., using cosine_similarity) to retrieve the top N most relevant document sections.
Example Query:
sql
Copy code
SELECT document_id, text_snippet, cosine_similarity(embedding, user_question_embedding) 
FROM contract_embeddings 
ORDER BY cosine_similarity DESC 
LIMIT N;
Return the top N most similar document snippets or sections.
7. Contextual Input to OpenAI for Answer Generation
Objective: Provide the retrieved document sections as context to OpenAI’s language model to generate a precise answer.
Process:
Input to OpenAI: Take the retrieved document sections (e.g., top 3 most relevant) and send them, along with the user's question, to OpenAI’s completion endpoint for processing.
Example prompt:
plaintext
Copy code
Here is a user question: "What are the payment terms in contract X?" 
Below are relevant sections from the contract:
1. Section: [Text Snippet 1]
2. Section: [Text Snippet 2]
3. Section: [Text Snippet 3]
Please provide an accurate answer based on these sections.
Output: OpenAI will generate a response based on the contract sections provided.
8. Chatbot Interface
Objective: Build an interface for users to input questions and view responses.
Process:
Develop a simple chatbot interface (e.g., using a web framework like Flask or FastAPI).
Connect the chatbot to the backend that handles:
User input
Sending the user question to OpenAI for embedding
Performing the vector search in PostgreSQL
Sending relevant documents to OpenAI for response generation
Display the OpenAI-generated answer, along with snippets of the contract used to derive it.
9. Scaling and Performance Optimization
Objective: Optimize the system for fast and accurate responses as the document volume grows.
Process:
Indexing: Ensure PostgreSQL indexes are optimized for vector search to reduce query time.
Batch Processing: Precompute embeddings for frequently asked questions to reduce overhead.
Scaling: Use database partitioning or sharding strategies to manage increasing contract volumes.
10. Security and Compliance
Objective: Ensure secure handling of sensitive contract data.
Process:
Encryption: Apply encryption both at rest (in PostgreSQL) and in transit (between components).
Access Control: Implement strict user authentication and access controls, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access specific contract information.
Ensure compliance with legal standards for handling contracts, such as GDPR or CCPA.
This specific workflow outlines how to leverage OpenAI for embeddings and language models, and PostgreSQL with pgvector for efficient storage and search of document embeddings.
