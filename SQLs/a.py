🔍 Sliding Window Approach for Image-Based PDF Text Extraction Using GPT-4o
This strategy is ideal when processing scanned multipage PDFs by converting each page to an image and using OpenAI GPT-4o's vision + text capabilities.

✅ How It Works:
Convert PDF to Images:

Each page of the PDF is rendered as an image (e.g., using pdf2image).

Define Sliding Window:

A window of N previous page texts (say, 3–5 pages) is maintained as context.

This context is passed as text alongside the current page's image.

Sequential Processing:

For the first page, the model gets only the image (no prior context).

For page 2 onward, the prompt includes:
“Here’s the prior context:\n<extracted text from previous pages>\nNow extract text from this image:”

This continues, sliding the window forward each time.

Accumulate Outputs:

The extracted text for each page is stored.

You may optionally validate or clean for redundancy due to repeated context.

🎯 Benefits:
✅ Context preservation across pages — improves extraction for documents where sentences, tables, or sections span multiple pages.

✅ Better semantic coherence, especially for legal, medical, or technical documents.

✅ Model-friendly input — balances between image and text, respecting token limits.

⚠️ Things to Watch:
Keep context window size within token limits (e.g., 3–5 pages max depending on text density).

Be cautious of drift or hallucination from outdated or overly long context.

Ensure clean text extraction per page, as noise can compound in context.
